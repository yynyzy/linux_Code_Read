!	setup.s		(C) 1991 Linus Torvalds
!
! setup.s is responsible for getting the system data from the BIOS,
! and putting them into the appropriate places in system memory.
! both setup.s and system has been loaded by the bootblock.
!
! This code asks the bios for memory/disk/other parameters, and
! puts them in a "safe" place: 0x90000-0x901FF, ie where the
! boot-block used to be. It is then up to the protected mode
! system to read them from there before the area is overwritten
! for buffer-blocks.
!

! NOTE! These had better be the same as in bootsect.s!

INITSEG  = 0x9000	! we move boot here - out of the way
SYSSEG   = 0x1000	! system loaded at 0x10000 (65536).
SETUPSEG = 0x9020	! this is the current segment

	 int 0x10 中断程序执行完毕并返回时，dx 寄存器里的值表示光标的位置，高八位 dh 存储了行号，低八位 dl 存储了列号.
	 mov [0],dx 就是把这个光标位置存储在 [0] 这个内存地址处。注意，这个内存地址仅仅是偏移地址，还需要加上 ds 这个寄存器里存储的段基址，最终的内存地址是在 0x90000 处，这里存放着光标的位置，以便之后在初始化控制台的时候用到.

! well, that went ok, I hope. Now we have to reprogram the interrupts :-(
! we put them right after the intel-reserved hardware interrupts, at
! int 0x20-0x2F. There they won't mess up anything. Sadly IBM really
! messed this up with the original PC, and they haven't been able to
! rectify it afterwards. Thus the bios puts interrupts at 0x08-0x0f,
! which is used for the internal hardware interrupts as well. We just
! have to reprogram the 8259's, and it isn't fun.

	mov	al,#0x11		! initialization sequence

! well, that certainly wasn't fun :-(. Hopefully it works, and we don't
! need no steenking BIOS anyway (except for the initial loading :-).
! The BIOS-routine wants lots of unnecessary data, and it's less
! "interesting" anyway. This is how REAL programmers do it.
!
! Well, now's the time to actually move into protected mode. To make
! things as simple as possible, we do no register set-up or anything,
! we let the gnu-compiled 32-bit programs do that. We just jump to
! absolute address 0x00000, in 32-bit protected mode.

	mov	ax,#0x0001	! protected mode (PE) bit
	lmsw	ax		! This is it!
	jmpi	0,8		! jmp offset 0 of segment 8 (cs)

! This routine checks that the keyboard command queue is empty
! No timeout is used - if this hangs there is something wrong with
! the machine, and we probably couldn't proceed anyway.
